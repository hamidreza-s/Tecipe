Tecipe
=====

Tecipe (pronounce it like recipe) is a lightweight and flexible TCP socket acceptor pool for Erlang. Its features are as follows:

- Accepting connections in two dynamic and static methods based on config for different purposes
- Parsing [Proxy Protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) (v1 and v2) for transporting connection information across NAT or TCP proxies
- Monitoring connections and reporting their statistics based on configuration
- Providing both TCP and SSL transport and being pluggable for adding new transports

Quick Start
-----

Include `tecipe` in the `rebar.conf` file of your project.

```erlang
{deps, [
        %% ...
        {tecipe, ".*", {git, "git://github.com/bisphone/tecipe.git", {branch, "master"}}}
       ]}.
```

Then start its application.

```erlang
ok = application:start(tecipe).
```

Now you can start a TCP listener with a `named-fun` as follows:

```erlang
Ref = foo, Port = 8080,
Handler = fun Loop(Transport, Sock) ->
              receive
                  {tcp, _, Data} ->
                      Transport:send(Sock, Data),
                      Loop(Transport, Sock);
                   _ ->
                      Transport:close(Sock)
              end
          end,

Acceptor = {acceptor, static},
Pool = {pool, 50},
Transport = {transport, tecipe_tcp},
Monitor = {monitor, true},
Proxy = {proxy, v2},
ListenerOpts = [Acceptor, Pool, Transport, Monitor, Proxy],
{ok, ListenerPID} = tecipe:start_listener(Ref, Port, Handler, ListenerOpts),
```

This way a static pool with 50 acceptors is started and echoes back every data it receives.

Tecipe Concepts
----

* **Listener**: An actor which is listening on a port and waits for new connections by its acceptors.
* **Acceptor**: An actor which accepts new connections and spawns workers to handle the connection.
* **Worker**: An actor which owns an accepted socket and does the logic.
* **Monitor**: An actor which is attached to a listener and monitors the workers and collects their stats.
* **Pool**: The number of acceptors which a listener created.
* **Transport**: An interface which must implement some required API to work with sockets.
* **Handler**: A function or MFA which is responsible to implement the logic of workers.

Acceptor Types
-----

* **Static**:

A listener with static acceptor pool accepts incoming connections inside the acceptors and then passes the socket to
a newly spawned actor which is called a worker. This way the acceptors remain intact and do not do anything except accepting
new connections.

```

* **Dynamic**:

A listener with dynamic acceptor pool accepts incoming connections inside the acceptors and makes it a worker, and then
a new acceptor is spawned. This way the acceptors are changed to workers and new acceptors are replaced with.

```


**Note**: *Both approaches could have good results in different scenarios. I have plan to write some benchmarks to show the differences.*

Monitoring Workers
-----

When the `monitor` option of a listener is set to `true`, a monitor actor becomes responsible for collecting the statistics and giving the report.
Using `get_stats/1` you can get the statistics as return value and format it as you want. However, there is a `print_stats/1` function which prints
all the available statistics as follows.

```
worker-pid      socket-port          monitor-ref          local-address        remote-address      proxy recv-cnt recv-max recv-avg recv-oct recv-dvi send-cnt send-max send-avg send-oct send-pend

* `start_listener/3,4,5` starts a new listener.
* `stop_listener/1` stops a previously started listener.
* `get_listener/1` gets information about a running listener.
* `get_workers/1` gets a list of a listener's workers.
* `get_stats/1` gets a detailed statistics about listener's workers.
* `print_stats/1` print the statistics of listener's workers.

Also there is a complete list of type specifications in Tecipe main [header file](https://github.com/bisphone/Tecipe/blob/master/include/tecipe.hrl).

Listener Options
-----

* `acceptor` defines the type of acceptor which could be `dynamic` or `static`. Default is `static`.
* `pool` defines the number of acceptor actors of a listener acceptor pool. Default is `5`.
* `monitor` defines whether the listener monitors their workers or not. Default is `false`.
* `transport` defines the using interface of tecipe which could be `tecipe_tcp` or `tecipe_ssl`. Default is `tecipe_tcp`.
